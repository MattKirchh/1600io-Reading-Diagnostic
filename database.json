            "discussion": "Most students mistakenly believe that if they run short of time on the reading section, it’s because they’re spending too much time reading the passages, leaving insufficient time to answer the questions. This appears to be due to two factors: If a student runs out of time on the final passage, it seems logical that if the passages were read in less time, there would be more time to answer the last set of questions, and it doesn’t seem possible to answer the questions more rapidly, so reading the passages more quickly is the only available option for shortening the total time needed to complete the section. However, our research has indicated that the opposite is true: rushing through the passages reduces comprehension so much that the time saved is more than consumed due to the increased time needed to answer the questions with the resulting impaired comprehension. The corollary to this, which is borne out through empirical evidence, is that increasing the time taken to read the passages to improve comprehension makes the questions so much easier to answer that the total time needed to complete a passage decreases. We’ve found that most students can complete the questions in less than seven minutes after acquiring a thorough understanding of the passage; that would leave, on average, six or more minutes to read the passage, which is far in excess of the 3-4 minutes typically recommended. It is also our opinion that even in the absence of a net time reduction, the score on the section increases with this approach.",
            "recommendation": "Try spending more time reading the passages until there are no further gains in comprehension and analyze whether the resulting reduction in question-answering time produces a net reduction in the overall time needed, and also whether the results are better."

First, it assumes that the resulting score will be higher than if you read more deliberately but didn’t finish answering all the questions, but there’s no particular basis for that belief; second, it assumes that because you’re reading the passages in less time, you’ll finish the section sooner, but often, skimming impairs your ability to answer the questions, so you spend more time referring back to the passage; and third, because it fails to accept the possibility that your reading speed can be improved.

This is false; in several years of asking for a single example of such a trick question, we have never been supplied with one.

Every question’s correct answer has supporting evidence in the text of the passage.

More specifically, you might be making the mistake of believing that a factually correct answer must be the right answer, but an answer choice can be factually correct while not actually providing an answer to the question as posed, or you might not notice that the question asks for the “best” answer (as many do), and, therefore, there might be multiple answers that are not absolutely wrong, but some might be better than others, so settling on the first not-wrong answer is a mistake.",

                "The SAT does an outstanding job of assessing your academic skills within the scope of the test, and the reading section is no exception. The reading section, just as with the rest of the test, cannot be effectively “gamed” and there are no secret “tricks” for making major gains, because in the end, you cannot escape the test’s exquisite ability to determine your level of reading comprehension skill.",
                "You must accept this reality. Once you do, you can move forward with improving the most important skills being assessed, and that means geniunely increasing your reading comprehension. It is indisputable that the people who have the best reading comprehension acquired that ability through reading – lots and lots of reading. Lifelong readers breeze through the reading section of the SAT, because they simply understand exactly what every passage is saying, so answering questions with that complete understanding is extremely easy. As we like to say, it’s an open-book test, so it should be simple to answer all the questions --  as long as you are able to understand the book.",

                        "There is a pervasive and debilitating misunderstanding regarding the use of practice tests, particularly when it comes to the reading section (though also for writing, to a lesser extent).",
                        "Doing lots of math problems of the sort found on the SAT is good practice for doing math problems on the SAT. Each SAT has 58 math problems of every (or nearly every) math topic the test is intended to assess. Therefore, using the math sections of practice tests for practice is efficient. The test problems are serving two distinct purposes well: providing the repetition needed to produce proficiency, and also giving an indication of how well the student is doing overall on the math sections of the test while providing feedback on which topics the student needs to learn more thoroughly.",
                        "This is deceptive, because it naturally produces the belief that as a general principle, those two functions are inseparable. But they're not, and, in fact, there can be only a small overlap between them, as in the case of the reading section. By contrast with the math section, the reading portion of the test doesn't provide significant reading practice, because it can't: the entire reading section consists of five passages, equivalent in length to perhaps 10 or 15 pages from a book, if that. According to the College Board, the reading section on one test has a total of about 3,250 words; a student could take 20 practice tests (65,000 words) and only have gotten reading practice equivalent to reading one short book such as \"The Catcher in the Rye\" (70,000 words), which is negligible in the scheme of things.",
                        "The reading section of the test is just an assessment (as it is intended to be); it is not suitable for reading practice. Of course, it's good practice for learning one's way around the format of the test, and for becoming familiar with the types of questions that can be asked, but it's essentially worthless when it comes to serving as practice for the underlying skill being tested: reading comprehension.",
                        "I liken it to a sports tryout, which serves as an assessment of the athletes skills. At such a tryout, each athlete performs a set of activities while being observed or measured. They might run a sprint, throw a ball, catch a pass, dribble around cones. They're being assessed, but no one would ever think that going through a bunch of tryouts is an optimal training regimen. For every sprint run in a tryout, an athlete might have run 1,000 sprints during training – and done work with weights, honed technique, and so on. The tryout is a performance, an assessment, a test--it's not training or practice.",
                        "In the math section, when a student gets a problem wrong, there's an immediate opportunity to acquire the needed skill, and a reasonable probability that the next time a problem pertaining to the same topic is encountered, it will be solved properly. With reading, though a student might understand why a specific question has a different answer than the one they selected, that experience contributes essentially nothing to enhancing the underlying skill of reading comprehension, which comes from actually reading, not from being tested on reading.",
                        "This stark difference in the practice value of the math and the reading sections on the SAT is at least partially responsible for a lot of confusion, frustration, and depression among students preparing for the SAT. They take math section after math section, and their scores increase. They get faster at what they know, and they learn what they don't. At the same time, they're taking reading section after reading section, and they see little or no improvement. They're engaging in what appears to be exactly the same type of activity, but they’re not seeing similar results. The problem is that they're mistaking assessment for practice when it comes to the reading section. To improve in reading--to really improve, not just to optimize the test-taking part of the game--requires practicing reading, not practicing taking the reading section of the SAT."

It is not learning tricks, secrets, test-taking tactics, and the like. The SAT does an extraordinarily good job of figuring out whether you’re good at reading or not, so there is no better way to score well on the test than to actually be good at reading.",
                        "When we tell students that the best way to improve their reading comprehensions skills (and speed) is through reading, they naturally ask, “what should I read?” As the SAT presents a wide variety of reading passages, the answer is, broadly speaking, read materials of the type, style, age, and subject matter that the test presents to you.",
                        "For specific recommendations on how to find reading materials that are most effective in producing broad gains in reading comprehension, see the reading materials recommendations section below.",
                        "Next, students often wonder how much they should read, or when they should read. This is an extremely important question, because having a pile of books or a set of article links won’t help if those materials don’t get read in sufficient quantities (or at all). In our experience, the best plan is for the student to establish a habit of reading at night after going to bed. We’ve observed that no matter how busy a student’s day is, there is typically a period of a half-hour to an hour or so after getting into bed when the student is engaging in relatively mindless phone-based activities – playing games, watching videos, scrolling their favorite social media app or forum, etc. We recommend trading in that time for reading. This is ideal for a number of reasons: It connects the reading period to an event that happens every single day without exception, so no excuses can be made (“I didn’t have time at lunch because I was doing homework”); it’s a quiet, comfortable environment for reading (if you can sleep during it, you can read during it), reading is conducive to falling asleep, so if you don’t read much because you doze off, it means you’re getting more sleep, and that’s generally a very good thing for teenagers, and you don’t have to transport your book so that it’s available wherever you may be when you want to read (though you can certainly do that as well).",
                        "Though simply reading a lot is the primary activity through which reading comprehension and speed are improved, the process of improving comprehension can be considerably aided with guidance. For that, we recommend attending 1600.io Live Reading Deep Dives, which are live events where a specific reading passage is read through with running commentary showing how to understand and retain the information being conveyed in order to maximize the ease with which questions about the passage can be answered. These cooperative, interactive demonstrations serve to lead students through the thought processes and principles that are important when reading anything, not just an SAT reading passage; remember, the SAT does a great job of assessing your reading comprehension skills, so acquiring those broad skills is the key."

It’s also vital to perform some self-diagnostics to ascertain specific aspects of reading or question interpretation that are inadequate so that you can address those shortcomings. This is all still part of the larger effort to improve your reading comprehension skills, though it uses the practice tests themselves as assessment materials for this diagnostic process.

                                "This point is discussed in some of the cause-specific recommendations above, but it bears repeating here. When students find that they are unable to answer all the questions for a passage within the 13 minute average time available, they naturally assume that they therefore need more time to work on the questions, and thus, they  must spend less time reading the passage. This line of reasoning, however, has an underlying fatal flaw: It assumes that amount of time needed to answer the questions doesn’t change, so the only possible way to shorten the whole process is to read the passage more rapidly, even if that means skimming. This is a mistaken belief, because the better your comprehension of the passage, the faster you can answer the questions; among other things, you won’t need to flip back and forth between questions and the passage nearly as often. This is not merely a theoretical supposition; 1600.io has observed large numbers of students answering questions for reading passages after maximizing their comprehension, and our data shows that most students can answer all the questions in less than about half of the 13 minutes available for the passage. This, in turn, means that you can spend 6-7 minutes reading to maximize comprehension, allowing you to use the remaining 6-7 minutes for answering the questions. This will produce a superior outcome, both in terms of time and score, when compared to trying to blaze through the passage in 3 minutes, then spending 10 minutes (or more) trying to answer the questions with only a fragmentary and vague understanding of the passage text."
